A simple and extendable slider block based on Swiper.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a very simple slider block which is based on [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/).
As of now, the plugin does not provide any slider configuration in the editor UI but provides many **PHP filter hooks** to change its behaviour.

The plugin is used in some custom themes and through it's PHP configuration it's perfect for a locked-in design (eg agency, clients).
Through the filters it's also very easy to extend in your own functions.php file.

== Installation ==

= Minimal Requirements =

- PHP 7.4 or newer
- WordPress 6.0 or newer

= Automatic Installation =

We recommend installing the plugin extension through the WordPress Backend.

= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the contents of the plugin zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

== Screenshots ==

1. Insert the Good Slider block into your content.
2. Add slides to your slider and insert any block you like into a slide.
3. The slide block also allows setting a background color and text color, so you don't need a group/cover block inside.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the swiper arguments (like slides shown etc) =

As of now, there are no configuration UIs in the editor.
You can use the `good-slider/swiper-options` filter hook to set the swiper configuration for a specific block instance.
All the available arguments are documented in the [Swiper documentation](https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api).

= Can I use my own enqueued Swiper script? =

Yes you can use the `good-slider/swiper-script-handle` filter hook to change the name of the swiper script handle.

= Can I use more Swiper options? =

By default, a stripped-down version of Swiper is enqueued, which only includes the most commonly used modules (A11y, Keyboard, Lazy, Navigation, Pagination).
You can use the `good-slider/swiper-script-handle` filter and set it to `good-slider-swiper-full` to enqueue the full Swiper bundle with all modules or you can use or own (see above).

= Will there be a UI for the block in the editor? =

Yes, we are working on exposing the most common configuration options (slides shown, spacing, colors,...) via the block's settings.

== Changelog ==
